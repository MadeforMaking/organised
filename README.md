# Organised

Bits and pieces to keep organised from code, configurations etc. Using this repository as a back up to this information. And a means to share it with others.

I'm a mechanical & manufacutring engineering by degree, so I also include 3D models that keep me organised. Using different [CAD](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Computer-Aided+Design) tools. Storing my custom designs here.
